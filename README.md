# Flea Market:
This is a full stack application that is a game in which the user buys items in a market and attempts to increase their bank total by selling the item at a higher price. Each market item price is set on a timer that randomly changes the price up or down every 15 seconds. This is my first time using ES6 classes and functions, and it was fun to learn and implement some of the new OOP fundamentals introduced into Javascript with this new version.


## Built With:
* Javascript
* ES6
* Node
* Express
* Grunt
